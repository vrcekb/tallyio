# Hot Path - Ultra-Fast MEV Detection and Execution Engine

Ultra-fast nanosecond-level MEV detection and execution engine for TallyIO.

## Performance Targets

- MEV Detection: <500ns
- Memory Allocation: <5ns  
- Cross-Chain Operations: <50ns
- Crypto Operations: <50Î¼s

## Features

- SIMD-optimized calculations
- Lock-free atomic operations
- Arena-based memory allocation
- Zero-cost abstractions

## Usage

```rust
use hot_path::{initialize, HotPathConfig};

let config = HotPathConfig::default();
initialize(config)?;
```
